Hello, my name is Kevin Ou, a dedicated professional at the crossroads of data science and data engineering, where analytical precision meets technological innovation. Originating from Memphis, TN, my academic path was carved at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a Bachelor's in Statistics, complemented by a certificate in Data Science. Currently, I'm enriching my expertise with a Master of Science in Data Science from Northwestern University, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence.

My technical arsenal is fortified with proficiency in Python, R, SQL, and a suite of data analytics tools, enabling me to transform complex datasets into compelling narratives and insightful analyses. My portfolio, punctuated by projects like the Kaggle Spaceship Titanic Prediction and a sophisticated COVID-19 Tracker App, stands as a testament to my ability to harness statistical models and data visualization to address real-world challenges.

In my professional realm, I've demonstrated my problem-solving acumen as a Technical Solutions Engineer at Epic Systems, where I ensure the seamless processing of medical claims through meticulous system analysis and software enhancements. My tenure as a Research Assistant and leadership role in the Illini Wushu Club underscore my collaborative spirit and commitment to fostering community through data-driven initiatives and organizational excellence.

I invite you to explore my journey and the ways in which I leverage data science and engineering to uncover insights, streamline processes, and drive innovation. Here you will find updates on my professional journey, my up-to-date resume, and a link to my LinkedIn page.
